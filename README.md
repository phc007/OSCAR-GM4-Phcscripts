## Greasemonkey Scripts Repository for OSCAR varients
This is a repository of my Greasemonkey 4 scripts for add on functionality.
Files without a fork name will work on many of them. Scripts with AV in the name are for Avaros. 
Scripts with OpenO are specific for OpenO.
Usually there is a description in the script header which explains their function.
These scripts are designed and tested for Greasemonkey and Violentmonkey on Firefox.
If you have to use Chrome you Tampermonkey is currently the only option.

### Instructions
1. Install the _monkey extension into your browser.  This involves opening the Extensions settings, searching for the extension and installing it.  You will need to enable the _monkey.  For Tampermonkey and Chrome you will need to allow developer mode and enable userscripts. 
2. Adjust your browser to allow popups for your OSCAR varient
3. Click on the userscript in this repository that you want
4. Click the button that says "Raw"
5. Allow the script to install into your _monkey

Note that waitForKeyElements.js is a fork of BrockA's excellent work in the public domaine
